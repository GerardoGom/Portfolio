This presentation offers a comprehensive overview of the challenges that I encountered as part of the data team at WPS.
Over the course of several months, it was my mission to come up with ways to automate several data management processes
while at the same time increasing accuracy and reliabilty.
The first half of the presenation gives relevant insight and background while the second half gives an indepth
technical overview.
