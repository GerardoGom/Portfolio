In this collaborative study of U.S. accident data, I served as the Results Analyst and Pattern Mining Lead, 
where I was responsible for transforming complex algorithmic outputs into interpretable safety insights. 
While the team worked on data cleaning and initial clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN), I specifically implemented the 
Apriori Algorithm using the MLxtend library to perform Frequent Pattern Mining. My primary focus was uncovering the 
non-obvious relationships between temporal factors, weather conditions, and road infrastructure to identify 
high-risk co-occurrences that contribute to accident severity. Beyond the technical implementation, I led the interpretation 
and visualization of these results, translating the association rules discovered by the Apriori model into actionable insights 
aimed at improving traffic management and accident prevention strategies.
